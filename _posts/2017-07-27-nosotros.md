Okey dokey playaz. Thanks to my handy dandy [Pafuera](http://pafuera.herokuapp.com) 
I've been schooled to tonight's happenings. Las Cafeteras and Helado Negro 
is playing at Lincoln Center for the Nosotros Fest. I've never seen either live. 
Get to it! No jueges! 

Las Cafeteras rocks the old Mariachi Jarocho style with their own East LA
influences. Helado Negro was probably playing in the background of that Netflix
you watch and wonder why people like.
