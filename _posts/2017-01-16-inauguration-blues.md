2016 was a nards-kick kind of year.

## Horror Count
* 8 divorced loved ones
* 10 beloved celebrity deaths
* 1 guy I witnessed toss himself in front of the train
* 1 Orange reality star elected President

I still have all my teeth though so that's something. Despite all that
I'm really looking forward to 2017 and scraping off the cobwebs from my old 
teenage activism. I played in angry, misdirected punk bands. I used to volunteer with Food Not Bombs. I was a part of Critical Mass. What happened to that guy?

As I look back at my pals from those days, some are still edgy and awesome,
but a few went from mohawks to polos; becoming the staunchiest
and the Republican-iest.

I catch them humming lyrics to their old favorite songs. Most of them rife
with hatred for the state of things: the obsession with power, ownership, 
personal empire; at odds with the people they've become.
