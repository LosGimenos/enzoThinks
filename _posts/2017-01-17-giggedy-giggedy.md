Doing some gig economy stuff because why not? It's fun to be on the other side
of on-boarding and see how these companies have automated so much of that process.
For those that require a bit more specialized of a skill set (driving cars)
the hand holding that they are engaged in is exactly the right move.
At the previous startup I was with, they didn't really trust the vendor to get it right;
and through that amazing mix of tradition and ego really stepped in way more than was necessary.

Headed to meetup at with some FirstMark folks. Looking forward to the bit on Webpack. 
I've definitely come around on it since I got heavy into React. Gonna be some stuff
on video delivery. Haven't messed around with that in a minute.
