Doing some gig economy stuff because why not? It's fun to be on the other side
of on-boarding and see how these companies have automated so much of that process.
For those that require a bit more specialized of a skill set (driving cars)
the hand holding that they are engaged in is exactly the right move.
At the previous startup I was with, they didn't really trust the vendor to get it right;
and through that amazing mix of tradition and ego really stepped in way more than was necessary.

Headed to meetup at with some FirstMark folks. Looking forward to the bit on Webpack. 
I've definitely come around on it since I got heavy into React. Gonna be some stuff
on video delivery. Haven't messed around with that in a minute.

##UPDATE

Meetup was great. The #CodeDrivenNYC folks throw a great shindig. Couple of things:
Was great to see the 1st Dibs crew talk about Webpack and their decision to use it
prior even to jumping on the React bus. It's what I use now but really for no other reason
than "Oh it was what we were using when I learned React". Was nice to see some extra utility.
Also, a splash on the workings of modern video and additionally why diagraming is 
the coolest.

Had an interesting conversation with a cat that was just going through an online code camp.
He asked me if I felt any kind of way about the possible over-saturation of the market.
Never really thought about it since I'm a bit of a newbie as a professional well, but really,
being in a place with so many other folks who were driven by tech, programming, and the like.
How, in the midst of all this amaze going on, can you look at someone and say,
'You really shouldn't be here'. The US doesn't make anything anymore. But we still have ideas
and an infrastructure in place that could be responsible for the best engineers in the world.
As it stands now we're desperately clinging onto an American Mystique that was long dead
even before I was born. We've ripped all of things out of the ground that we need to. 
Even if not, everyone else around the world can do it cheaper with more. 
Unless we're talking about empire again (I will not have it) why aren't we 
throwing everything we got into the things we have in abundance, ideas grown 
with that casual confidence that can only come with the terroir of relative freedom 
and freakin' cyberspace.
