Listen: a whole lot of scared and pissed off folks fought through the cold
to gleam some comfort from standing around and chanting from time to time. 
Feels good I guess to have some celebrities in your corner. My own voice is like
a creepy whisper from the sad guy at the bar. Hey folks! Rhetoric still works!
The build up from Al Sharpton is like Walker Texas Ranger kicking down a 
saloon door. That boy still got it. We all got a beautiful earful from 
what would be an amazing superhero team: Robert DeNiro, Michael Moore, 
the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Al Sharpton, Julianne Moore, Cher, Natalie Merchant, 
Alec Baldwin, and others. The who's who cadre of progressives. And out there
in the multitude we stood with bad signs and aching backs. But it was important
to be there. It's important because although no one will know that I was ever there,
as I was simply a small blip in that sea, no one can take from me that 
small choice: that although it was warm and comfy in my apartment, I went
out into the night and whooped and hollered against a real fart of a person
that rode a river of slime into the White House. Trust me, it's just the first
of such nights.

I let the terrror take me for a bit there to be sure. But all that is over
now. Time to get to work.

such feat <br>
and bad echoes <br>
make the lines hard <br>
for ears <br>
to accept<br>
I dig deep in my<br>
pockets<br>
in search of warmth<br>
and let a monied class<br>
tell me things will be ok<br>
but there were also ones<br>
with something really on the line<br>
and they spoke with fury<br>
and fight<br>
and I know damn well<br>
we won't be stepping back<br>
or rewinding any such clock<br>
and I'm safe in the here<br>
and now<br>
for my sin of being brown<br>
was washed away <br>
when they ate the hoses<br>
and beatings and burnings and hangings.<br>
I'm safe in the here<br>
and now <br>
