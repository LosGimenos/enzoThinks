Listen: I can't think of such an intense policy Blitzkrieg in my lifetime.
So far El Trumpez has gagged federal funds to clinics worldwide, gagged
any science from the Parks Department (where's Leslie Knope when you need her?),
stopped visas from 'muslim' countries (well the ones that don't have Trump properties),
and is about to announce The Wall. It's only Wednesday, y'all.

Last Saturday's march however has instilled enough hope in me to last the year.
Weeeeee!!

Meetups are the best. I was at CocoaPods and another on Juju Charms this weekend.
The teaching aspect of meetups is my favorite. For as many Youtube tutorials that are
out there, there's still something primal about sitting around a space having someone
speak at you all the learning. I've also had the chance to step into workspaces in glorious
buildings downtown. I've worked out of a high-rise in Chelsea, but damn if those downtown views
don't beat all.

There are some cats out in Brooklyn that have a pretty good setup with folks that are
coming out of a bootcamp. They're working with each other to fill in the gaps with
small lectures that they're leading themselves. Great for accountability and a sense
of ownership. Love this team.

I'm at the Crowded.com meetup tonight. The todo made about it is a little off-putting
but they have some legit speakers there tonight. Plus, it's free pizza. FREE. PIZZA.
BTW, where's the story-arc of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles where they all start going to
meetups for the free pizza?

Crowded meetup was fabu! Always great to see hiring folks connect with the dev community.
Oh...and sometimes 'pizza' means 'sandwiches'.
