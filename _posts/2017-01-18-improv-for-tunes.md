I listen to Matt Besser's (UCB OG) Improv for Humans podcast as my sometimes
kill time on the train and have a laugh vehicle. Though the podcast itself
is fabu, one great thing they do is invite indy musicians to play live on the recording
and the subsequently gleam some inspiration for an improv scene based on a
lyric or a memory or mood that was just splashed around.

All of that is excellent, but my favorite bit is that the recordings of these
nuanced musicians, utilizing different timbres of instruments, sound AMAZING.
Whoever produces that stuff, or whatever gear they are using, puts out some of the best
audio on a podcast that I have ever heard.
