What have we done? 

Was watching a buddy's kid over the weekend and was subjected to a 'hot new game' that said kid had just discovered. This was the gist: click a monster, get gold to buy more click damage and passive DPS. THAT. WAS. IT. No strategy. No real visualizations of the 'heroes'. Sprites for the monsters themselves were recycled after a few stages. And this kid could not get enough. He sat clicking for hours. 

Putting the UX hat on for a bit I asked him what was so cool about this game. 
"Man, you keep getting just like insane amounts of gold. It's funny sometimes how much gold you can get."
Is that really enough to define an engaging experience in the 8 - 15 year-old male demographic? For the next couple of weeks on this specific game it looks like the anwser is yes.
