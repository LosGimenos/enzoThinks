"She was warned. She was given an explanation. She persisted."

This about sums up the pendejada coming out of government right now. I'm 
loving 2017 so far (despite aforementioned pendejada), but I'm itching

and interpreting data. Possibly next in the 50 Shades series? An intimate act
of data parsing?
